This file contains notes for my progress in fixing the bug that undercharges civil actions for wonder cards.

entry point 1
PrototypeDefinition name="PickCard"
TriggerAction Menu "Add Card to Hand" = ctrl A
-> alt ctrl shift A
-> ctrl back quote

CardSlot name="Colossus"
-> Delete
-> ALT 1 to WonderUC

PieceSlot name="WonderUC" ALT 1
-> Set WonderUC.WonderUC = 1
-> Report $playerSide$ ($playerName$) has begun work on a Wonder, $Wonder_Name$! *
-> Increment Global.BlueCivil -$BlueWonders$
-> Increment Global.BlueUsedCivil $BlueWonders$
-> Report $playerSide$ ($playerName$) has completed $BlueWonders$ Wonders, so spends an extra $BlueWonders$ Civil action(s) to start construction on $Wonder_Name$ (automatically adjusted). *

entry point 2
PrototypeDefinition name="AgeACivil"
TriggerAction when ctrl A and Cost = 1 and Wonder = True
-> ALT SEMICOLON
-> CTRL SEMICOLON to WonderUC

PieceSlot name="WonderUC" CTRL SEMICOLON
-> Increment Global.BlueCivil -1
-> Increment Global.BlueUsedCivil 1

Solution found
in PrototypeDefinition name="AgeACivil"
change
TriggerAction when ctrl A and Cost = 1 and Wonder = True
to
TriggerAction when ctrl alt shift A and Cost = 1 and Wonder = True


did 2 things:
1) Added report when msg received by wonderuc pieceslot
2) added trigger action to ageacivil that doesn't care about cost or wonder flag
3) Done last time changed in ageacivil ctrl-a to ctrl backquote (was ctrl shift alt a)--neither worked

---restore old---

* Blue (Ken Stevens) has begun work on a Wonder, Colossus! *
* Blue (Ken Stevens) has completed 0 Wonders, so spends an extra 0 Civil action(s) to start construction on Colossus (automatically adjusted). *
* cs8 cost is 3 wonder is True
* alt cost is 3 wonder is True
* ctrl a cost is 3 wonder is True
* cs9 cost is 3 wonder is True

Worked on the colossus!
Because I disabled delete on it!

ctrl a report always works on PrototypeDefinition name="AgeACivil"
but ctrl a trigger does not work
even without properties
so if delete, i can report but not trigger
