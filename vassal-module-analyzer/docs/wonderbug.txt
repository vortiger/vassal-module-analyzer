This file contains notes for my progress in fixing the bug that undercharges civil actions for wonder cards.

entry point 1
PrototypeDefinition name="PickCard"
TriggerAction Menu "Add Card to Hand" = ctrl A
-> alt ctrl shift A
-> ctrl back quote

CardSlot name="Colossus"
-> Delete
-> ALT 1 to WonderUC

PieceSlot name="WonderUC" ALT 1
-> Set WonderUC.WonderUC = 1
-> Report $playerSide$ ($playerName$) has begun work on a Wonder, $Wonder_Name$! *
-> Increment Global.BlueCivil -$BlueWonders$
-> Increment Global.BlueUsedCivil $BlueWonders$
-> Report $playerSide$ ($playerName$) has completed $BlueWonders$ Wonders, so spends an extra $BlueWonders$ Civil action(s) to start construction on $Wonder_Name$ (automatically adjusted). *

entry point 2
PrototypeDefinition name="AgeACivil"
TriggerAction when ctrl A and Cost = 1 and Wonder = True
-> ALT SEMICOLON
-> CTRL SEMICOLON to WonderUC

PieceSlot name="WonderUC" CTRL SEMICOLON
-> Increment Global.BlueCivil -1
-> Increment Global.BlueUsedCivil 1

Question: was Cost = 1?

Checking PrototypeDefinition name="AgeACivil"

Added debugging report statements

Can't get debugging statements to display
